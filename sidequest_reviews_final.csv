Harmony - Meditate in Mixed Reality,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36982/harmony-meditate-in-mixed-reality,One of those unique MR meditation experience which you don't see usually in the VR world. Needs little fine tuning and i can see the app doing wonders. Cheers to the creators❤️,5
Artax,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36984/artax,"I love third person games and i liked this alot more then i thought i was. Moving different toys through an adventure with skeletons, wolfs and zombies where the world automatically moves around you just brings you into the game. It started off with a few issues where the world was just to slow to move but as you get used to it and further levels you just bring your self into this world. If you enjoy sat down third person type games then i would check this one out, with great graphics and lighting on the quest 3 for a port of an old GO game.",4
Artax,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36984/artax,Artax is a port of an Oculus Go game that was a huge classic. I have never played the original but this game is just as good now as I know it was back then. This game puts you in the shoes of a knight who is looking for his fellow solider in a fantasy diorama rpg adventure. The classic top down or god view is a staple here and might just be one of the originals to use this angle. The environments are designed very well as it captures a dark and gritty atmosphere where you never know what is coming next. The characters are clean and the animations are done properly too. I couldnt help but feel like I was playing Dark Souls while playing this game. The combat is a bit simple but it works very well with the game. The story is very captivating and it makes you want to keep progressing. There are even action scenes that really make this game an epic adventure. Well worth downloading if you played the original or if you want to see this game for the first time. Great RPG/Adventure to have in your library!,5

DIG VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37173/dig-vr,Dig VR is a great way to show off what it is like to be the guys and gals who work construction in a daily life. This game is very much a simulator that allows you to take the controls of a Digger in a variety of forms. There are several control schemes here that are adjustable for comfort but the full blow experience lets you get hands on with each and every level in the cabin. I was super impressed with how well it ran and how it truly shows you what its like to drive these things. It really puts in perspective what it takes when your house is getting built or any other major projects in the real world. If your into simulator games this plays very much like Lawn Mower simulator just with a Digger.,5
DIG VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37173/dig-vr,"I'm really enjoying this game! If you're a fan of games like House Flipper, Car Mechanic Simulator, or Thief Simulator, you'll definitely enjoy it. The cozy atmosphere, crazy scenarios, and fun mini games like bowling with a digger are a lot of fun. You get lots of customization options and of course upgrading your digger is the greatest of rewards. I'm impressed by how authentic the game mechanics feel - I've never driven a digger in real life, but after playing this, I feel like I could give it a shot! The scenarios are hilarious, and I've had a blast playing this game. It's definitely a great find!",5

Oktoberfest,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37675/oktoberfest,"This is by far one of the best experiences I have had in Virtual Reality to date. This game may not look like its a big deal but trust me it is. The game puts you into the Oktoberfest Festival in Munich which is really really cool. Now the graphics may not be amazing but let me tell you the gameplay make sup for it BIG TIME. You are able to drop into the game with friends and basically tour this amusement park like you would in real life. There are several carnival games, food, and even rides to get on that make you feel like you are really there. You can run into people and compete at games which really adds a great layer to the game. There are also leaderboards and a massive hall of fame for the top players at each game. I am sure they will be adding more and more rides and games to the festival as it really shows what can be done with a game like this. The environment is so lively and quite impressive. The game is free so there is no reason not to try this game at all. If your into having fun with friends this is a must have game.",5
Oktoberfest,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37675/oktoberfest,"I went in with zero expectations, but this game is a blast. You can throw cans, serve food, ride crazy rides, and somehow we ended up stacking people in a giant tower (best feature imo). The Trombone game is hilarious, and the outfits amazing. I started with friends but ended up hanging with randoms, and we had a great time. Seriously, just jump in and try it!",5

Hotel R'n'R - Rockstar Simulator,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37403/hotel-rnr-rockstar-simulator,Pretty fun rage-room esque experience with a surprisingly deep and interesting lore!,4
Hotel R'n'R - Rockstar Simulator,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37403/hotel-rnr-rockstar-simulator,"Hotel R'n'R is pure chaotic fun! You play as a rockstar who makes a deal with the devil, leading to absolute mayhem as you trash hotel rooms. The game is super polished, and the way the music blends with the sound of all the destruction is a blast. I had a ridiculous time smashing things up with a boxing glove and a foam finger, and every level keeps things fresh. If you’re in the mood for some wild VR destruction, Hotel R'n'R is definitely a game to check out.",5
