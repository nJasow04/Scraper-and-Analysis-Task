/t5/Announcements/Meta-Quest-build-v69-release-notes/ba-p/1237980,"Woohoo! v69 is starting to roll out! These features and enhancements will become available starting the week of September 5, 2024 and will be pushed to Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 2 headsets. Required update for Meta Horizon social experiences Beginning in October, v69 will be required for those enjoying Meta Horizon social experiences such as Horizon Worlds, Horizon Workrooms, and co-presence. Those who have not yet upgraded will be prompted to update to v69 before they can access these experiences. “Hey Meta” wake word on Meta Quest We’ve introduced a new way to invoke Meta AI by using your voice. When you turn on this feature in Meta AI Settings, you can say “Hey Meta” to engage with the assistant. Learn more about Meta AI assistant . Window layout In v67, we announced a new window layout for Meta Quest that was accessible from the Experimental Settings. Now in v69, this window layout will be turned on for everyone. Spatial audio for windows Audio from select windows will sound like it's coming from those windows' locations around you, which can provide richer and more realistic audio. This does not affect audio within fully immersive apps. Remove apps from Library Take care of visual clutter in your library with the ability to completely remove unwanted apps and worlds, including leftover apps that you’ve already uninstalled. Select “Remove from library” from the app or world’s library menu and make it easier to find and access your content. Bluetooth quick pairing You can now quickly pair supported Bluetooth devices like headphones, keyboards, mice, and gamepads when they’re in pairing mode and near your headset. Turn on [Get nearby device notifications] in your Bluetooth settings to get notified when a nearby device is available for pairing, and select the notification to pair. Seamless multitasking You can now multitask more effectively by keeping the universal menu and up to three windows open during immersive experiences. This can be used to look up information, watch videos, or chat with friends while staying engaged with your immersive games and apps. Seamless Multitasking can be enabled in Experimental Settings. Content-adaptive backlight control Improves contrast and battery life by adjusting the backlight of your headset based on the content you’re viewing. Boundary improvements Your boundary is more dynamic now with frictionless access to Meta Horizon Home. By automatically placing you into a stationary boundary when you visit your Home, you’ll no longer have to repeatedly find or create a room scale boundary. You’ll still be asked to create a room scale boundary when you open immersive experiences that require them. Head tracked cursor interaction improvements Improves the behavior of the head tracked cursor to stay hidden when it’s not wanted, such as watching a movie or using 2D apps, and appears when you need it. Permissions history You are now able to view the last 7 days of sensitive permission access by installed apps through a new panel within your Settings. Privacy settings updates We are making privacy settings easier to use with Meta Horizon Worlds, and simplifying settings for everyone in a few ways: Control your privacy across Meta Quest and Horizon Worlds in a more unified way. Control your visibility and status from the social tab. Stylus support Tracked stylus devices including Logitech MX Ink can now be used to interact with the universal menu. You can learn how to use it, configure its button mapping, and adjust its pressure sensitivity in Stylus settings. Horizon Home: Oceanarium Escape to the Oceanarium, our latest Horizon Home. Immerse yourself in an underwater world filled with seaweed and anemones that flow with the gentle ocean currents. Get up close and personal with sea turtles, manta rays, and even a majestic whale while you experience the beauty of the ocean like never before."

This enhanced understanding of your immediate physical space is achieved by sending point cloud data from your device to Meta servers for processing.

Please add the tag ""PTC v65"" to the thread and in the title. This way everyone can look for just PTC v65 issues too.

/t5/Announcements/Meta-Quest-build-v64-release-notes/ba-p/1180797,"These features and enhancements will become available starting the week of April 8, 2024 and will be pushed to Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 2 headsets. Please note that you can find the most up to date release notes on our release notes article and you can check out our v64 blog as well for more details. Lying down now on Quest 3 Lying down is now available on Quest 3. Kick back, relax and recline for casual experiences including media playback and stationary immersive gaming. You can enable this feature by going to Experimental in Settings and selecting the toggle next to Use Apps While Lying Down. Once enabled, you can use this feature by laying down and then pressing and holding the menu button to reset your view. External mic support (Quest 3 only) You can now use an external microphone with your Quest 3 headset. You can plug a mic directly into the headset’s USB-C port, or use an adapter to connect a mic through the USB-C port. Once you’ve plugged in your external mic, you can switch to it by going to Experimental in Settings and selecting the external mic. Keep casting when headset taken off Previously, when you removed your headset while casting, the livestream would go black. Now when you take off your headset while casting to the Meta Quest app, the stream will stay alive, providing an improved and more seamless casting experience. Directly Join friends in Horizon Worlds We’re testing new ways to make it easier to join up with friends in Meta Horizon Worlds. If your friend is online with their location shared and in a public world, you can join them directly from the People app on the universal menu. You can control the sharing of your Active Status on  Quest ( learn more ) and in Meta Horizon Worlds, where you can also control the sharing of your world location ( learn more ). Passthrough improvements Passthrough is the fundamental mixed reality capability that allows users to comfortably view and interact with the physical world while wearing a headset. Today we are announcing a number of improvements to the passthrough experience that will roll out to all users on Quest 3 with the v64 release. Improved resolution We have improved the perceived resolution for passthrough by optimizing the passthrough pipeline. This makes it easier for users to see finer details and read smaller text in the real world - such as notifications on a smartphone screen. Improved image quality We have fine tuned the camera processing pipeline to improve color, exposure, contrast and dynamic range in passthrough. This makes color passthrough better match the real world. We have also reduced graininess (aka image noise) in lower light conditions making for an overall more comfortable passthrough experience in a range of lighting conditions. Update We wanted to provide an update regarding the scoped storage fix. Although it was implemented in v.63, we also wanted to share that Google has published guidelines for managing all files on a device that supports scoped storage: https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/manage-all-files#all-files-access These guidelines offer valuable information on permissions and APIs that application developers can use to maintain the same level of file management capabilities as before the scoped storage fix was introduced. We encourage you to consider these guidelines when updating your apps for optimal results."

/t5/Announcements/Meta-Monthly-September-Recap/ba-p/1088959,"The month of September was excitement all around for Meta’s Connect 2023 as well as a lot of other events sprinkled throughout the month. Read on to see some of the highlights from not only the Connect event, but other happenings announced throughout the forums. MVP Connect Events Last week we got our MVPs together for a few events surrounding Connect and the launch of Quest 3. One of them we wrote about here , where our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game turned into an FAQs session for the whole community. Another event that took place was during the actual day of Connect. The Community team and MVPs gathered to watch the Keynote through Bigscreen Beta. We were gathered amidst the camp-style theater to eat our virtual popcorn while our host @Ryanality live streamed the event through YouTube VR. It was a fun time with our MVP squad. Also, while we’re on the topic of MVPs, we are growing the team! Back in April when we first launched, we initially started with four of our top forum veterans: @DaftnDirect , @Hiro_Protag0nist , @kojack and @nalex66 . Since the program started, they have been hard at work getting your questions answered and discussing all things Quest and VR. Since they’ve done such great work, we’ve decided to open more spots to the community and have since recruited some additional folks that we feel have encompassed the qualities of a true MVP. Let’s all give it up for @007xSlayerx007 , @baroquedub , @J40NYR , and @NathanSudo . If you see them around, make sure to say hello! More information is here if you are interested in joining the team. Connect and Quest 3 There were a number of exciting announcements at Connect 2023.

/t5/Announcements/Quest-3-amp-Connect-talks-with-our-MVPs-and-the-Meta-team-Top-5/ba-p/1088564,"Last week we held various events around Connect with our MVPs, one of which was our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game. This time, since it was the Friday (or Saturday for some) of Connect week, we centered the game around all things Connect and Quest 3. We were joined in by Meta’s Ryan Goddard, Social Marketing Manager - VR communities to help answer questions and talk shop. @kojack , @J40NYR and @nalex66 along with @Ryanality joined in and asked questions for the community. Here are the top 5 questions (with a bonus question!) that were asked and answered. It includes some additional commentary from our Product Specialist team: 1) Will there be more support for Augmented Reality dev like an AR kit or AR core? As announced at Connect 2023, there will be a large slate of tools and showcases such as: Unity: Unity Project Setup Tool, Building Blocks, MetaXR Simulator, AR Foundation, Discover and MR Utility Kit Unreal Engine: MR Template, MetaXR Simulator, Unreal Engine XR best practices, Platform SDK and MR Utility Kit 2) Will the Quest 2 accessories fit the Quest 3? Quest 3 will offer a range of accessories to personalize your headset experience with added comfort, control, customization, performance, and convenience. You can check them out here: https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/ Accessories from Quest 2 such as headbands or straps may not fit without a conversion kit as the arm connectors on the sides are differently sized. Quest 3 has a USB-C port on one arm and a 3.5mm audio port on the other as well. 3) Will the Quest 3 be compatible with Quest Pro controllers? Yes! You can use the Quest Touch Pro Controllers with Quest 3. 4) What makes the optical stack in the new lenses stand out from other pancake equipped headsets out there? It is our Most Advanced Display & Optics Technology yet, from lifelike games and documentaries to fantastical landscapes, Meta Quest 3’s visuals are so spectacular you’ll want to reach out and touch the world around you. Our 4K+ Infinite Display achieves a nearly 30% leap in resolution compared to Meta Quest 2. You get 25 pixels per degree and 1,218 pixels per inch for the best resolution across the entire Meta Quest line. Our next-gen pancake lens optical stack gives Meta Quest 3 a 40% slimmer optic profile compared to Meta Quest 2 without compromising your depth of visual immersion. Sharpness also gets a 25% boost compared to Meta Quest 2, with significantly fewer stray and scattered light artifacts. Read more details here . 5) Where do you see the future of Meta and PCVR? With that in mind are there any improvements to Link and Airlink that we can expect with Quest 3? Quest Pro may be the preferred headset for our PCVR enthusiasts due to WiFi 6 support and local backlight dimming. That said, Quest 3 still makes for an amazing experience on PCVR and D-Link VR Air Bridge will be supported on Quest 3 headsets. Bonus: What was the feature your team was most excited about during development of the Quest 3? Improved performance 8GB RAM Newest Qualcomm XR2 Gen 2 chipset Pancake optics stack (thinner profile similar to Quest Pro) 2.2K resolution Comfortable and ergonomic design Compact controllers 15% reduced neck strain Continuous IPD adjust Manual eye relief adjust Advanced Mixed Reality Dual RGB cameras Structure light projector for depth Contact pads on bottom of device for charging dock accessory Julie, Meta’s VR/AR Product Specialist is really excited about the sound quality improvements. “It's better than the Quest 2 and Pro! There's not much marketing material on these enhancements, but it continues to impress me.” She's also excited about ""auto boundary"". “It's just one less step in jumping into VR. Seems like a small upgrade, but truly valuable if you spend a lot of time in VR. “ We hope this answers a lot of the questions you had on the Quest 3! Let us know in the comments below if you’ve already put in your order! Also if you’re interested in events like these and think you’d be a good fit as an MVP, reach out to @Ryanality or @neurodivrgent for more details! Cheers!"

/t5/Announcements/Meta-Monthly-September-Recap/ba-p/1088959,"The month of September was excitement all around for Meta’s Connect 2023 as well as a lot of other events sprinkled throughout the month. Read on to see some of the highlights from not only the Connect event, but other happenings announced throughout the forums. MVP Connect Events Last week we got our MVPs together for a few events surrounding Connect and the launch of Quest 3. One of them we wrote about here , where our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game turned into an FAQs session for the whole community. Another event that took place was during the actual day of Connect. The Community team and MVPs gathered to watch the Keynote through Bigscreen Beta. We were gathered amidst the camp-style theater to eat our virtual popcorn while our host @Ryanality live streamed the event through YouTube VR. It was a fun time with our MVP squad. Also, while we’re on the topic of MVPs, we are growing the team! Back in April when we first launched, we initially started with four of our top forum veterans: @DaftnDirect , @Hiro_Protag0nist , @kojack and @nalex66 . Since the program started, they have been hard at work getting your questions answered and discussing all things Quest and VR. Since they’ve done such great work, we’ve decided to open more spots to the community and have since recruited some additional folks that we feel have encompassed the qualities of a true MVP. Let’s all give it up for @007xSlayerx007 , @baroquedub , @J40NYR , and @NathanSudo . If you see them around, make sure to say hello! More information is here if you are interested in joining the team. Connect and Quest 3 There were a number of exciting announcements at Connect 2023.

/t5/Announcements/Quest-3-amp-Connect-talks-with-our-MVPs-and-the-Meta-team-Top-5/ba-p/1088564,"Last week we held various events around Connect with our MVPs, one of which was our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game. This time, since it was the Friday (or Saturday for some) of Connect week, we centered the game around all things Connect and Quest 3. We were joined in by Meta’s Ryan Goddard, Social Marketing Manager - VR communities to help answer questions and talk shop. @kojack , @J40NYR and @nalex66 along with @Ryanality joined in and asked questions for the community. Here are the top 5 questions (with a bonus question!) that were asked and answered. It includes some additional commentary from our Product Specialist team: 1) Will there be more support for Augmented Reality dev like an AR kit or AR core? As announced at Connect 2023, there will be a large slate of tools and showcases such as: Unity: Unity Project Setup Tool, Building Blocks, MetaXR Simulator, AR Foundation, Discover and MR Utility Kit Unreal Engine: MR Template, MetaXR Simulator, Unreal Engine XR best practices, Platform SDK and MR Utility Kit 2) Will the Quest 2 accessories fit the Quest 3? Quest 3 will offer a range of accessories to personalize your headset experience with added comfort, control, customization, performance, and convenience. You can check them out here: https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/ Accessories from Quest 2 such as headbands or straps may not fit without a conversion kit as the arm connectors on the sides are differently sized. Quest 3 has a USB-C port on one arm and a 3.5mm audio port on the other as well. 3) Will the Quest 3 be compatible with Quest Pro controllers? Yes! You can use the Quest Touch Pro Controllers with Quest 3. 4) What makes the optical stack in the new lenses stand out from other pancake equipped headsets out there? It is our Most Advanced Display & Optics Technology yet, from lifelike games and documentaries to fantastical landscapes, Meta Quest 3’s visuals are so spectacular you’ll want to reach out and touch the world around you. Our 4K+ Infinite Display achieves a nearly 30% leap in resolution compared to Meta Quest 2. You get 25 pixels per degree and 1,218 pixels per inch for the best resolution across the entire Meta Quest line. Our next-gen pancake lens optical stack gives Meta Quest 3 a 40% slimmer optic profile compared to Meta Quest 2 without compromising your depth of visual immersion. Sharpness also gets a 25% boost compared to Meta Quest 2, with significantly fewer stray and scattered light artifacts. Read more details here . 5) Where do you see the future of Meta and PCVR? With that in mind are there any improvements to Link and Airlink that we can expect with Quest 3? Quest Pro may be the preferred headset for our PCVR enthusiasts due to WiFi 6 support and local backlight dimming. That said, Quest 3 still makes for an amazing experience on PCVR and D-Link VR Air Bridge will be supported on Quest 3 headsets. Bonus: What was the feature your team was most excited about during development of the Quest 3? Improved performance 8GB RAM Newest Qualcomm XR2 Gen 2 chipset Pancake optics stack (thinner profile similar to Quest Pro) 2.2K resolution Comfortable and ergonomic design Compact controllers 15% reduced neck strain Continuous IPD adjust Manual eye relief adjust Advanced Mixed Reality Dual RGB cameras Structure light projector for depth Contact pads on bottom of device for charging dock accessory Julie, Meta’s VR/AR Product Specialist is really excited about the sound quality improvements. “It's better than the Quest 2 and Pro! There's not much marketing material on these enhancements, but it continues to impress me.” She's also excited about ""auto boundary"". “It's just one less step in jumping into VR. Seems like a small upgrade, but truly valuable if you spend a lot of time in VR. “ We hope this answers a lot of the questions you had on the Quest 3! Let us know in the comments below if you’ve already put in your order! Also if you’re interested in events like these and think you’d be a good fit as an MVP, reach out to @Ryanality or @neurodivrgent for more details! Cheers!"

/t5/Announcements/Meta-Monthly-September-Recap/ba-p/1088959,"The month of September was excitement all around for Meta’s Connect 2023 as well as a lot of other events sprinkled throughout the month. Read on to see some of the highlights from not only the Connect event, but other happenings announced throughout the forums. MVP Connect Events Last week we got our MVPs together for a few events surrounding Connect and the launch of Quest 3. One of them we wrote about here , where our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game turned into an FAQs session for the whole community. Another event that took place was during the actual day of Connect. The Community team and MVPs gathered to watch the Keynote through Bigscreen Beta. We were gathered amidst the camp-style theater to eat our virtual popcorn while our host @Ryanality live streamed the event through YouTube VR. It was a fun time with our MVP squad. Also, while we’re on the topic of MVPs, we are growing the team! Back in April when we first launched, we initially started with four of our top forum veterans: @DaftnDirect , @Hiro_Protag0nist , @kojack and @nalex66 . Since the program started, they have been hard at work getting your questions answered and discussing all things Quest and VR. Since they’ve done such great work, we’ve decided to open more spots to the community and have since recruited some additional folks that we feel have encompassed the qualities of a true MVP. Let’s all give it up for @007xSlayerx007 , @baroquedub , @J40NYR , and @NathanSudo . If you see them around, make sure to say hello! More information is here if you are interested in joining the team. Connect and Quest 3 There were a number of exciting announcements at Connect 2023.

It uses procedural generation to assemble a new dungeon every time you play, and each contains a different mix of combat rooms, traps, puzzles, and other types of chambers. To celebrate the launch, we spoke with two of Othergate’s co-founders—Designer Ryan Rutherford and Programmer Andrew Welch—about creating their own unique fantasy mythology, the challenges they faced while building the game, and how they plan on updating Dungeons of Eternity in the future.

/t5/Announcements/Quest-3-amp-Connect-talks-with-our-MVPs-and-the-Meta-team-Top-5/ba-p/1088564,"Last week we held various events around Connect with our MVPs, one of which was our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game. This time, since it was the Friday (or Saturday for some) of Connect week, we centered the game around all things Connect and Quest 3. We were joined in by Meta’s Ryan Goddard, Social Marketing Manager - VR communities to help answer questions and talk shop. @kojack , @J40NYR and @nalex66 along with @Ryanality joined in and asked questions for the community. Here are the top 5 questions (with a bonus question!) that were asked and answered. It includes some additional commentary from our Product Specialist team: 1) Will there be more support for Augmented Reality dev like an AR kit or AR core? As announced at Connect 2023, there will be a large slate of tools and showcases such as: Unity: Unity Project Setup Tool, Building Blocks, MetaXR Simulator, AR Foundation, Discover and MR Utility Kit Unreal Engine: MR Template, MetaXR Simulator, Unreal Engine XR best practices, Platform SDK and MR Utility Kit 2) Will the Quest 2 accessories fit the Quest 3? Quest 3 will offer a range of accessories to personalize your headset experience with added comfort, control, customization, performance, and convenience. You can check them out here: https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/ Accessories from Quest 2 such as headbands or straps may not fit without a conversion kit as the arm connectors on the sides are differently sized. Quest 3 has a USB-C port on one arm and a 3.5mm audio port on the other as well. 3) Will the Quest 3 be compatible with Quest Pro controllers? Yes! You can use the Quest Touch Pro Controllers with Quest 3. 4) What makes the optical stack in the new lenses stand out from other pancake equipped headsets out there? It is our Most Advanced Display & Optics Technology yet, from lifelike games and documentaries to fantastical landscapes, Meta Quest 3’s visuals are so spectacular you’ll want to reach out and touch the world around you. Our 4K+ Infinite Display achieves a nearly 30% leap in resolution compared to Meta Quest 2. You get 25 pixels per degree and 1,218 pixels per inch for the best resolution across the entire Meta Quest line. Our next-gen pancake lens optical stack gives Meta Quest 3 a 40% slimmer optic profile compared to Meta Quest 2 without compromising your depth of visual immersion. Sharpness also gets a 25% boost compared to Meta Quest 2, with significantly fewer stray and scattered light artifacts. Read more details here . 5) Where do you see the future of Meta and PCVR? With that in mind are there any improvements to Link and Airlink that we can expect with Quest 3? Quest Pro may be the preferred headset for our PCVR enthusiasts due to WiFi 6 support and local backlight dimming. That said, Quest 3 still makes for an amazing experience on PCVR and D-Link VR Air Bridge will be supported on Quest 3 headsets. Bonus: What was the feature your team was most excited about during development of the Quest 3? Improved performance 8GB RAM Newest Qualcomm XR2 Gen 2 chipset Pancake optics stack (thinner profile similar to Quest Pro) 2.2K resolution Comfortable and ergonomic design Compact controllers 15% reduced neck strain Continuous IPD adjust Manual eye relief adjust Advanced Mixed Reality Dual RGB cameras Structure light projector for depth Contact pads on bottom of device for charging dock accessory Julie, Meta’s VR/AR Product Specialist is really excited about the sound quality improvements. “It's better than the Quest 2 and Pro! There's not much marketing material on these enhancements, but it continues to impress me.” She's also excited about ""auto boundary"". “It's just one less step in jumping into VR. Seems like a small upgrade, but truly valuable if you spend a lot of time in VR. “ We hope this answers a lot of the questions you had on the Quest 3! Let us know in the comments below if you’ve already put in your order! Also if you’re interested in events like these and think you’d be a good fit as an MVP, reach out to @Ryanality or @neurodivrgent for more details! Cheers!"

Changes for Quest 1 As we look to the future, we are grateful to the Quest 1 community and remain committed to supporting its users.

Here’s an overview of what’s ahead: You will still be able to use your Quest 1 headset and available apps. We won’t be shipping new features to Quest 1 starting with v50. We plan to continue maintaining the system software with critical bug fixes and security patches until 2024. You will still be able to use Quest 1 devices beyond 2024.

If you have any questions about these changes or about your Quest 1 headset, we encourage you to contact Meta Store support . 2D app multitasking When we launched Meta Quest Pro, one of our favorite new features was the ability to bring up a 2D app (like the Meta Quest Browser) without closing the game we were playing. With v50, we’re excited to bring this feature to Meta Quest 2 as well. Check your Instagram feed, look up the location of a Lost Ball in Walkabout Mini Golf , or get a bit of work done while you’re killing time in Demeo ’s Heroes’ Hangout—all without leaving your current app or experience.

We’re also adding text labels in Quick Settings to make it easier to navigate. To open the Quick Setting panel, press the Meta Quest button on your right Touch controller to pull up your universal menu, then select the clock on the left side of the universal menu. Improved Touch Pro controller tracking We are improving performance on the Touch Pro controllers , reducing the time for tracking to initialize.

/t5/Announcements/Meta-Quest-build-v44-release-notes/ba-p/987277,"These features and enhancements will become available starting the week of September 15, 2022. Advanced Creator Settings We want to empower creators to capture and deliver high quality experiences to help connect and grow engagement from their audiences. As such, we’ve added Advanced Camera Settings that can be enabled from your Experimental Settings panel in VR. Once enabled, you’ll have access to these additional camera settings: Image Stabilization : Choose how much to reduce the appearance of headset movement in your videos. Increasing image stabilization decreases the field of view. Aspect Ratio: Choose your default format and resolution for photos and videos. We heard your requests, and are happy to add that 1920x1080 or ""Landscape"" is now possible. Frame Rate : Choose your default frame rate for videos. Higher frame rates can negatively impact app performance. Video Compression Quality : Choose a default bit rate for videos. Higher bit rates improve video quality but also increase file size. Parental Supervision We continue to add features to our Parental Supervision tools for VR. Two of the newest additions include: Block Developer Mode: Parents can now block teens from using their headset in developer mode through Parental Supervision tools. Blocking developer mode will prevent teens from installing apps on their Meta Quest that may not be available on the Meta Quest App store using a connected device or computer. Note, this will be rolling out gradually. Unlock Pattern for Apps You can now lock multiple apps with a single PIN entry. With this update, you can also filter and lock apps based on rating categories. You can find this feature by selecting Settings > Security Settings > App Lock."

/t5/Announcements/Horizon-Workrooms-is-moving-to-Meta-accounts/ba-p/981960,"Ahoy, everyone! We have some new information for our friends using Horizon Workrooms! A lot of you have been transitioning over to Meta Accounts recently, and as we've started to roll that migration to everyone, we feel it's imperative you know the details, what a meta account is, and what you should do to prepare for the migration. Without further ado, rev up those fryers and get ready to delve into Workrooms! What to expect On August 30, 2022, users will be signed out of Workrooms and asked to create a Meta account to log back in. Don't worry, as frightening as that sounds, we'll help guide you through the process and help you migrate across your existing workrooms, including any associated files. How to prepare First thing's first is to plan ahead - check your calendar. If you have meetings planned on or after August 30th, make sure you and your team factor in time to set up your new Meta account and migrate your workrooms. Keep in mind, this may take several minutes. Be sure you're coordinating with all participants to make sure everyone has created their Meta account and migrated their workrooms in advance. The last thing you'd want is to be waiting in a room full of executives because Jeremy is still migrating his account. What's a Meta account? A Meta account is brand-spankin'-new technology! It's a new way to sign up for Workrooms and other Meta VR products, giving you more choice about how you access VR. You heard that right, needing a Facebook account to use that new Quest 2 grandma got you is a thing of the past! You can use the email of your choice to log in, letting you separate your social accounts from work with ease. Isn't that great? What else can I do with a Meta account? With this new-fangled Meta account tech all the kids are using these days, you can do all sorts of cool things with it! One thing in particular is the ability to join a meeting with a single click from your headset all without needing to pair your device. This means you can see all your workrooms in one place if you have multiple accounts! Alright, denizens of the VR era, that was all the information we have to update you with! Please send us questions, comments, and even your favorite clips as you explore Workrooms. Should you need any pointers, we've created a support article to answer some of your burning questions. We hope you all have a jolly good time collaborating across the open seas of the internet, so hoist the anchor, lower the sails, and prepare to set off on new adventures - Workrooms awaits! Keep on collaborating because remember - sharing is caring!"

/t5/Announcements/Meta-Monthly-September-Recap/ba-p/1088959,"The month of September was excitement all around for Meta’s Connect 2023 as well as a lot of other events sprinkled throughout the month. Read on to see some of the highlights from not only the Connect event, but other happenings announced throughout the forums. MVP Connect Events Last week we got our MVPs together for a few events surrounding Connect and the launch of Quest 3. One of them we wrote about here , where our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game turned into an FAQs session for the whole community. Another event that took place was during the actual day of Connect. The Community team and MVPs gathered to watch the Keynote through Bigscreen Beta. We were gathered amidst the camp-style theater to eat our virtual popcorn while our host @Ryanality live streamed the event through YouTube VR. It was a fun time with our MVP squad. Also, while we’re on the topic of MVPs, we are growing the team! Back in April when we first launched, we initially started with four of our top forum veterans: @DaftnDirect , @Hiro_Protag0nist , @kojack and @nalex66 . Since the program started, they have been hard at work getting your questions answered and discussing all things Quest and VR. Since they’ve done such great work, we’ve decided to open more spots to the community and have since recruited some additional folks that we feel have encompassed the qualities of a true MVP. Let’s all give it up for @007xSlayerx007 , @baroquedub , @J40NYR , and @NathanSudo . If you see them around, make sure to say hello!

/t5/Announcements/Quest-3-amp-Connect-talks-with-our-MVPs-and-the-Meta-team-Top-5/ba-p/1088564,"Last week we held various events around Connect with our MVPs, one of which was our weekly Walkabout Mini Golf game. This time, since it was the Friday (or Saturday for some) of Connect week, we centered the game around all things Connect and Quest 3. We were joined in by Meta’s Ryan Goddard, Social Marketing Manager - VR communities to help answer questions and talk shop. @kojack , @J40NYR and @nalex66 along with @Ryanality joined in and asked questions for the community. Here are the top 5 questions (with a bonus question!) that were asked and answered. It includes some additional commentary from our Product Specialist team: 1) Will there be more support for Augmented Reality dev like an AR kit or AR core? As announced at Connect 2023, there will be a large slate of tools and showcases such as: Unity: Unity Project Setup Tool, Building Blocks, MetaXR Simulator, AR Foundation, Discover and MR Utility Kit Unreal Engine: MR Template, MetaXR Simulator, Unreal Engine XR best practices, Platform SDK and MR Utility Kit 2) Will the Quest 2 accessories fit the Quest 3? Quest 3 will offer a range of accessories to personalize your headset experience with added comfort, control, customization, performance, and convenience. You can check them out here: https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/ Accessories from Quest 2 such as headbands or straps may not fit without a conversion kit as the arm connectors on the sides are differently sized. Quest 3 has a USB-C port on one arm and a 3.5mm audio port on the other as well. 3) Will the Quest 3 be compatible with Quest Pro controllers? Yes! You can use the Quest Touch Pro Controllers with Quest 3. 4) What makes the optical stack in the new lenses stand out from other pancake equipped headsets out there? It is our Most Advanced Display & Optics Technology yet, from lifelike games and documentaries to fantastical landscapes, Meta Quest 3’s visuals are so spectacular you’ll want to reach out and touch the world around you. Our 4K+ Infinite Display achieves a nearly 30% leap in resolution compared to Meta Quest 2. You get 25 pixels per degree and 1,218 pixels per inch for the best resolution across the entire Meta Quest line. Our next-gen pancake lens optical stack gives Meta Quest 3 a 40% slimmer optic profile compared to Meta Quest 2 without compromising your depth of visual immersion. Sharpness also gets a 25% boost compared to Meta Quest 2, with significantly fewer stray and scattered light artifacts. Read more details here . 5) Where do you see the future of Meta and PCVR? With that in mind are there any improvements to Link and Airlink that we can expect with Quest 3? Quest Pro may be the preferred headset for our PCVR enthusiasts due to WiFi 6 support and local backlight dimming. That said, Quest 3 still makes for an amazing experience on PCVR and D-Link VR Air Bridge will be supported on Quest 3 headsets. Bonus: What was the feature your team was most excited about during development of the Quest 3? Improved performance 8GB RAM Newest Qualcomm XR2 Gen 2 chipset Pancake optics stack (thinner profile similar to Quest Pro) 2.2K resolution Comfortable and ergonomic design Compact controllers 15% reduced neck strain Continuous IPD adjust Manual eye relief adjust Advanced Mixed Reality Dual RGB cameras Structure light projector for depth Contact pads on bottom of device for charging dock accessory Julie, Meta’s VR/AR Product Specialist is really excited about the sound quality improvements. “It's better than the Quest 2 and Pro! There's not much marketing material on these enhancements, but it continues to impress me.” She's also excited about ""auto boundary"". “It's just one less step in jumping into VR. Seems like a small upgrade, but truly valuable if you spend a lot of time in VR. “ We hope this answers a lot of the questions you had on the Quest 3! Let us know in the comments below if you’ve already put in your order! Also if you’re interested in events like these and think you’d be a good fit as an MVP, reach out to @Ryanality or @neurodivrgent for more details! Cheers!"
