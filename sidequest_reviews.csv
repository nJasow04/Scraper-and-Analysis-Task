Run,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37279/run,"Great. However, multiplayer and bigger map to switch to would make this 5 stars, although I guess you would need to add avatars for multiplayer which would require more dev. Thank you to your team.",4
Run,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37279/run,"Great start! Love the coin/diamond collecting, plus the environments look great. Makes doing a half hour/hour workout fly by. Wishlist to make it better: 1) allow player to mute in-game music 2) allow player to set (or simply increase the default) joystick turn speed, it's way too slow right now, makes it very difficult to tur if you're using a treadmill or elliptical where turning your physical body is not an option 3) if jogging in place, it's almost impossible to do so and remain stationary, the player inevitably inches forward when completely immersed in a virtual environment. One solution might be to add a MR passthrough window on the floor/underneath the player so you can tell if you're drifting forward",4

Beef Raider XR - Tomb Raider in VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/38086/beef-raider-xr-tomb-raider-in-vr,"Hello, I think it's a great game. I'm a very, very big fan, but I feel in my soul that it's not in Spanish. It's possible one day.",5
Beef Raider XR - Tomb Raider in VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/38086/beef-raider-xr-tomb-raider-in-vr,"Team Beef, you legends, you've done it again! Cant wait to see what treasures you port to the store offically :)",5

Split Second,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37171/split-second,"Split Second is made ay a single developer that has put in some work on other games and has perfecting their craft. This is inspired by Ready Or Not and it shows big time here. The game is basically as the description shows, a tactical CQB shooter which puts you in multiple locations. Each locations has its own scenario which you can choose in a day or night cycle which I love. I was really impressed by how well the game runs and the layout of some of the levels. You truly must play the game slow and methodical in order to succeed. You can select from various weapons and customize them to your liking. The game does offer n endless mode where you can practice which is pretty fun and you can hone your skills nicely there. The game does need a little polish but the game is constantly being updated.",5
Split Second,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37171/split-second,amzing but should add sandbox,5
FortiCasa,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37703/forticasa,"This game is awesome!!! Its not free, but the demo is. I have already spent a couple of hours in this.

I have played it almost 1hour. Controller is smooth and I can control my car even better from other games. I need you to add more competitors and cars and highways please.

Q-Linq,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37172/q-linq,"VR adds another puzzler to its librayr with Q-LinQ. What I like about this one is its a matching game where you must match all the colorful orbs to each other which can be easy, and at times a challenge. You can speed up the revolving puzzle or slow it down to strategically place your orbs which makes it a bit easier and relaxing. The story is interesting as the whole thing plays out in an A.I. world with A.I. characters. Its the first time I have really seen the use of AI and its voice to make a whole story which I found very interesting. Worth a download if your into puzzlers, bright colors, and a scifi AI story!",4
Q-Linq,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37172/q-linq,"Welcome to Q-Linq, a brand new game from a solo developer, 4D4 Games. Q-Linq is a bubble-popping match 3 puzzle game where the player needs to match three or more bubbles to make them disappear. Q-Linq will be a fan favorite, mostly because it’s fairly easy to understand, simple to play, and entertaining. The levels are quick and with each passing level, you feel a sense of accomplishment. Q-Linq has bright colors and graphics that makes the game more enjoyable and interesting. There are two play options: story and arcade. The story mode takes you on a journey as a cadet training to power quantum engines. The goal of the story mode is to guide the player into learning and discovering more advanced mechanics that come along later in the story. The arcade promises endless replayability, literally, as it doesn’t have a level limit. This is a fun and addictive modern VR bubble-popping/match 3 puzzle game! It is well-polished and enjoyable for an App Lab game. Great job!",5
DuckHuntVR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37628/duckhuntvr,"This VR game perfectly captures the nostalgia of retro gaming, brought to life with stunning realism. A must-play for anyone seeking a heartfelt blend of past and present",5

Galaxy Kart,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37176/galaxy-kart,Galaxy Kart has finally officially made its way to the Meta store and there are several reasons why. This is truly the Mario Kart in Virtual Reality that wee have wanted. There are a ton of tracks with several ways to race them and a ton of wacky characters to go with it. There are different vehicles to choose from which adds to the mayhem. I love how to you physically aim your power ups at your opponents to overtake them on the track too! This game will definitely make your bring your VR legs as there is some speed and a ton of movement while racing so just be careful if your not a VR Vet quite yet!,4
Galaxy Kart,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37176/galaxy-kart,"Galaxy Kart VR is a blast! I’m not usually into racing games because they make me super motion sick, but this one surprised me. The comfort settings really helped, so I could actually enjoy the chaos without feeling too queasy. The tracks are super fun, with crazy food-themed designs, and the power-ups like ketchup squirts and bombs keep things wild. The controls took a minute to get used to, but once I did, I was zooming all over the place. Definitely worth checking out!",5
Galaxy Kart,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37176/galaxy-kart,"As someone who firmly believes that speed and chaos go hand in hand, I recently dove into the wild world of Galaxy Kart VR, and let me tell you, it was like strapping a rocket to my childhood dreams (think Mario Kart)! I gathered my bravest friends for a multiplayer showdown, ready to see who could master the art of kart combat. From the moment we entered the game, I knew we were in for a treat. Each of the characters are eccentric, with skills that had us rolling on the floor with laughter. My friends and I couldn’t stop cracking jokes (and trash talking) as we tried to navigate the tracks while avoiding each other’s ridiculous power-ups. The multiplayer feature is where the real magic happens. The tracks themselves are beautifully designed, making you feel like you're zooming through a galaxy filled with colorful planets and ridiculous obstacles.",5
Crazy Taxi VR - Car Driving | Car Simulator,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36337/crazy-taxi-vr-car-driving-car-simulator,"I would so love a Crazy Taxi style game in VR or even a really good Taxi car game. You’re driving a Ferrari like car, zipping through the city, picking up passengers, and racing against time. The VR really pulls you in where you can almost feel the wind as you drift around corners and dodge traffic. The passengers are hilarious, throwing out lines like, Good Job, Wait wait wait, stop stop. It’s all about speed, crazy stunts, and having fun. The music’s high-energy, keeping you pumped the whole time. Have some suggestions make car more intractable, add pedestrian. Crazy Taxi will take you on a fun journey with a real driving experience!",5
Crazy Taxi VR - Car Driving | Car Simulator,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36337/crazy-taxi-vr-car-driving-car-simulator,"Give it a try, effective sounds and easy to control. an excited driving experience in vr.",5
Crazy Taxi VR - Car Driving | Car Simulator,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36337/crazy-taxi-vr-car-driving-car-simulator,"I gave Crazy Taxi a try because I wanted to be a crazy taxi driver. The game is a little bland with a couple issues. However, I made it fun by goofing off in the open world, jumping ramps (but for some reason, you land between buildings with no exit, having to restart the level), cutting corners over the curbs, making people scream from close-calls driving by. Needs more people and pedestrians in the game. Some taxi rides are way too short, literally just a few steps away (lazy people!). I loved that your taxi is a Lamborghini!! But I was hoping to have a variety of rides as shown in the pictures in the levels, and level up the vehicles as you progress in the game. AI passengers choice of words need improvement. “Stop stop stop” and “be in time” are annoying. I really wanted to like this game. It’s just ok. I came across another game called Velocity Car Driving Simulator and the images from that game appears to have the same map as Crazy Taxi.",3

The Mixologist,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37978/the-mixologist,"This game is so much fun, even though I'm always awful at these types of games—but that's what makes it great! Seeing your Meta avatar in the game adds a personal touch, and there's tons of replay value with customers asking for different drinks each time. It gave me flashbacks to my restaurant days with impatient customers and the occasional thrown drink. The only reason I can’t give it the full 5 stars is based off some issues grabbing drinks in the game. When reaching for a bottle, I would move the rotating shelf and when trying to move the shelf, I would grab a bottle. But I know that can be a quick fix so I hope to give this the full 5 stars soon! If you enjoy simulating real-world jobs but want a brighter, more fun twist, this game is the one!",4

The Exit 8 VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37167/the-exit-8-vr,"This is a port of the PC flat screen version into VR on standalone. The game runs great and has all the spooky elements that the original version has which is fantastic. The object of the game is you are basically on a loop unless you can spot the anomaly that is hidden very well within each floor. Its not easy as its a very intense game of eye spy and will test your game of memory at every corner. I really like the feeling of the liminal space which makes it creepy, as well as some of the jump scares it gives. Super cool to see from a pro developer team and is a good download if you like liminal space and puzzle solving!",4
The Exit 8 VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37167/the-exit-8-vr,"I recently ventured into The Exit 8 VR, expecting a relaxing stroll in an underground maze. Right off the bat, I found myself in a never ending passageway. It was like a twisted version of “hot and cold”—but I was just getting colder! After what felt like forever, I finally stumbled upon Exit 8, and I could almost hear the walls sigh in relief. If you’re in the mood for some giggles mixed with a dose of existential confusion, this game is perfect! Just remember: in the underground world of Exit 8, the only thing scarier than the anomalies is getting lost in your own thoughts! Happy wandering!",5

Pencil,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37685/pencil,"This is a must have game if you are into drawing or you want to learn to draw. The game really is unique when using the color passthrough for the quest 3 and in my opinion one of the best ways to use it. Incorporating learning with the quest is a major win on many levels and this game proves what can be done. You are able to choose from several different options based on your skill level and the game takes you step by step to learn how to create the drawling. After enough practice you can start to freehand based on the things you have learned. I can not draw worth a darn, so this game really helps you to build the confidence to create a masterpiece. Very unique and intuitive game that really is a creative way to use mixed reality. I hope they add more things to draw over tile as there is only a few to pick from at the moment. Great game and great for all ages!",5
Pencil,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37685/pencil,"This app exceeded my expectations. What I thought was a simple tracing app turned out to be a comprehensive drawing course. It teaches you the fundamental drawing skills like Form, Value, Lighting and so on using mixed reality. I really loved the fact that I could adjust the opacity of the layers so that I could still see what I was drawing. There is also some 3D models included in the app, and you have the possibility to import your own images or models too. Pencil is great for beginners but is also nice for more advanced people. The mixed reality and hand-tracking was flawless. If you want to learn a new skill, this might be the one to try out!",5
Pencil,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37685/pencil,"I LOVE THIS! Pencil XR does a great job utilizing the Meta Quest 3’s Mixed Reality. I love seeing MR being used for learning. I have never been good at drawing and have very poor handwriting in general. Pencil XR makes me happy to be living in this day & age where technology like this can be used to help people learn. I really enjoyed putting my hand to pencil, to paper, and actually creating something. Leo, the art teacher is so adorable and charming. I highly recommend this for all ages!",5

You have the ability to chose your box, answer the phone to the banker and even swap your box at the end. Sound affects are cool but the screen jitters a little when turning.

VENDETTA FOREVER DEMO,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36770/vendetta-forever-demo,"This is a Frenetic FPS Puzzle game using Low Kill Motion. This is a unique movement system meaning you can only traverse the maps by killing the enemy, grabbing their weapon, and taking their place. The Puzzle part of this game has to do with the need to carefully plan out your kills. You want to ensure that you’re choosing the right targets to carve the best path that leads you to your final destination. The enemies in this game all carry a variety of weapons, ranging from pencils and knives to swords and multiple types of guns. You'll want to make note of which weapon each kill gets you so you can have enough good ammo to get through each level. I have nothing but good things to say about Vendetta Forever, and highly recommend checking it out!",5

Escaping Wonderland,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37938/escaping-wonderland,"If you are a fan of the first game, Down the Rabbit Hole, this game is a must. Once again the story of falling into Wonderland cant be told in a better way. This time you take control of Molly, and you get to experience the tales with familiar faces and puzzles. The one big thing that adds to this new game is the way some of the puzzles are done. I absolutely love the added touch of going into first person view in order to solve some of the tougher puzzles and it really adds a whole new level of immersion to it. Well worth check out if your into diorama type vr games and puzzlers.",5
Escaping Wonderland,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37938/escaping-wonderland,Such a fantastic story driven puzzler. Traveling up the diorama and completing puzzles were very well done and and the voice acting is top notch. Possibly one of the best narrative driven VR Games of 2024. An absolutely must buy if your looking for good puzzles and solid story!,5
Escaping Wonderland,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37938/escaping-wonderland,"Escaping Wonderland is a charming VR puzzle game that takes you on a journey through Lewis Carroll's classic Alice in Wonderland. The game features beautiful visuals, engaging puzzles, and a delightful story. Players take on the role of Molly, a girl who finds herself in Wonderland for the first time. Molly must navigate through a series of interconnected dioramas, solving puzzles and interacting with various characters along the way. However, some players may find the game's relatively short length and lack of character depth to be drawbacks. Despite these minor shortcomings, Escaping Wonderland remains a highly recommended VR game that is sure to please fans of Alice in Wonderland and puzzle games alike.",5
Freeland,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36966/freeland,"This game has absolutely massive potential! Explore multiple worlds, fight enemies fight enemies with magic, guns and swords, race down mountains and so so much more!

Play with friends or go it alone, there seems to be endless amounts of content and there will constantly be more to come.

This game can be played with friends in a horde/wave shooter with multiple zombies, weapons, and ways to have fun. I really like how the game is designed with massive boss's to fight throughout the level and puzzles to solve to get them to unlock. I had a ton of fun playing it and your efforts are well worth the payoff with special weapons to unlock after completing these bosses. There is some pretty good character and weapon customization as well which really lets you and your friends stand out from each other.

Airspace Defender,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37568/airspace-defender,I dont know if its just me but i really wasnt impressed with this game. The controls are not that easy to pick up even when you are using your hands. Theres not much to the game ist like old school misile command but i found myself missing all the rockets. The mixed reality is pretty cool with its old school green matrix look but maybe i was expecting a bit more from this.,3
Airspace Defender,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37568/airspace-defender,This game is great! It reminds me of the old school arcade game and feels really great using the mixed reality color passthrough of the Quest 3. The added bonus of using your hand tracking really adds that extra level of fun to it too. I love the different types of missiles you can unlock and use to a strategic advantage. This game defiantly takes some time to master but once you do it really gets challenging. It seems to farther you get in the game the harder it gets! Even though this is only a demo alot is going on here and the devs have done a great job with it so far. I cant wait to see what is next for this game in the full version!,5
Airspace Defender,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37568/airspace-defender,"ENTER THE WAR ROOM From the very first moments of Airspace Defender, you're thrust into a captivating and unique atmosphere, thanks to its blend of mixed reality and 3D tabletop gameplay. While the controls may seem a bit confusing at first, managing the 3D game board becomes second nature after just a few minutes. The learning curve is quick, and before long, you’re fully immersed, losing track of the real world as the gameplay pulls you in. Minimalist yet Retro Design That Stands Out One of the most striking features of Airspace Defender is its minimalist design, which prioritizes clarity and accessibility while maintaining a distinct visual style. The game board is clean yet varied, offering a smooth and distraction-free gaming experience. This aesthetic choice enhances your sense of control, all while delivering a subtle retro vibe. This nod to arcade games of the past can be felt throughout the experience, particularly in the scoring system and the way the difficulty ramps up, modernizing the charm of classic arcade titles for today’s players. Modern Gameplay with a Retro Twist Where the game truly shines is in its clever use of mixed reality and hand tracking, providing a deeper sense of immersion and making you feel directly involved in the action. Managing your city’s defenses requires precision and strategy, as you carefully time your counterattacks while unlocking new upgrades to keep up with the increasingly difficult enemies. Progression feels rewarding as each victory brings new turrets and funds, helping you fortify your defenses and face tougher challenges. A Steady Increase in Difficulty: A True Challenge Airspace Defender excels in its steadily increasing difficulty. Like the classic arcade games of yesteryear, the early levels are relatively easy, allowing players to get accustomed to the gameplay. But soon, the opposition ramps up, and the stakes get higher. You find yourself constantly pushed to your limits, striving to climb the leaderboards and defend your city from relentless attacks. Will you emerge victorious and claim your place in history, or will your city fall under siege? Conclusion Airspace Defender is a well-crafted game that masterfully blends retro and modern elements into a mixed reality experience that will thrill fans of both strategy and arcade games. Its intuitive gameplay, clear and minimalist design, and perfectly balanced difficulty make it a captivating and addictive title. Defending your airspace has never been more satisfying.",5

Dimensional Double Shift,https://sidequestvr.com/app/38056/dimensional-double-shift,"Today we're doing a review of a game that was just announced called Dimensional Double Shift! When I was approached and asked if I could cover a new unannounced game by Owlchemy Labs, I was very curious to take a look. So guys grab your punch card, clock in, and let's start this review up! Dimensional Double Shift is releasing this September 26th, 2024 and will be available for the low cost of zero dollar. You heard me right! This game will be free at launch. The game is compatible with the Quest 2, Pro and 3 and the developers of the game are Owlchemy Labs who are the famous creators of the well beloved Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator! Alright lets get this show on the road! Gameplay / Restaurant First and foremost, I want to give a massive thanks to Live Open Mike for helping me out and joining my session. So Dimensional Double Shift is a game where you're thrown in a job where you have to work in co-op with up to 4 players to accomplish your tasks in the fastest and cleanest way. During the release, there are 2 types of jobs that you can do. Your first job is being a cook at a restaurant. You have to make 8 orders in total together with your friends. Your workstation will be randomly generated, so every time that you play the game, you may have different ingredients and tools at your disposition. This game has kind of an Overcook vibe, you first need to select an order from the rack on top and scan it in your section. You will then be presented with ingredients that you need to prepare and put on a plate or in a cup. When you're done, you hit the bell to tell that your order is ready, and then you move on to another order. There are challenge orders that you can pick, and they don't tell you all of the ingredients that you need. For example, they could tell you that you need a pancake with any 3 ingredients in it. So you'll need to use your imagination and put maybe chocolate, blueberries and a banana, and then you're good to go! When you're done with the 8 orders, you go in overtime, and you have a timer where you need to make as much orders as possible to have one last chance to increase your score, and then you're done! Live Open Mike told me that he was a cook for more than 10 years, so he was able to transfer his skills pretty good in the game, and it really showed as he was definitely doing better than me. What's also cool is that sometimes the ingredients that you need are at your co-worker's station. So you have to communicate in order to be the most efficient. Gameplay / Garage The second game that you have is the garage, me and Live Open Mike confirmed that this was our favorite game from the 2. Basically you have a car that you bring up, and you have all kinds of things that you have to fix in it. It's the same thing where everything seems randomly generated. And this one definitely requires more teamwork. For example, we'll have some kind of device that we'll need to crank together, or there is this one time where I needed to pour oil in the car, but I had no idea how much I needed to poor, so Mike had to tell me when to stop. In this game, you'll get 2 cars to repair before it ends, and yeah you just have a bunch of handy tools needed to make the car work, such as a machine that creates cogwheels for you. So you just have to dig around and figure out everything that's wrong with the car. Features / Character Customization Before anything else, when you start the game for the first time, you are inside a hub and a robot greets you to explain how the game mechanics work. Dimensional Double Shift is actually hand tracking only! So you'll need to put the controllers aside and just use your hands. To select anything, you just need to pinch with your fingers, and that is also how the keyboard works. The game is co-op only, so you cannot start the game unless you have someone joining you. The way it works is very similar to Walkabout Minigolf or a lot of other games where you enter a password, and people can join you by putting the same word. It'd be nice if eventually you could get matched with random people, I could see that being very fun. The last thing you can do in the initial hub is customize your character! You can select things such as your skin color, hair style and color, and then you can select accessories such as your wristband, a hat and visor's color. Enough things to differentiate your character from others. You also have a nametag that you can smash 2 names together to identify yourself. Learning Curve / Progression So something that I find cool with the game is that there's not really any tutorials. I like that you just have to figure out stuff with your co-worker. It was a fun experience, and when we tried the games for a second time, we could see ourselves improve since we started understanding more what we needed to do. So it's a really fun game to go in blind. When you finish your tasks, you are then transported back to the hub with your friends, and you get points that will make you rank up. If you do rank up, then you unlock a new item that you can use to customize your character. Something interesting is that it seems to be randomly generated. Mike and I were never receiving the same items, even though we're in the same rank. Speaking of the hub, you can also get transported to a campfire to shill out. You can use a stick and cook some sausages and marshmallow, and you can also do silly things like cook your can of pop, or burn your hands. And then there's the radio that you can turn on. The radio will have some music, or even silly things like a poet dictating his creation, and things like that. So guys I hope that you enjoyed my review of Dimensional Double Shift. As you can see, you can have an infinite amount of playtime in this since situations in both games are randomly generated, and fun! The questions that I'm asking myself for the future of the game is will there be new games added later? If not, even though you could end up having fun for hours, the variety still seems a little barebone. The second question that I have is will there be the possibility to purchase things in the game with in game currency, and what will they be exactly.",5

Stunt Double Joe McFlash,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37493/stunt-double-joe-mcflash,This game is pretty fun. I'm terrible at driving games in VR but still enjoy playing them if the fun factor is there. This game definitely is fun yet challenging. The game features multiple movies with various scenes to play through and unlock. The graphics are very basic but doesn't take away from the fun factor of the game at all. Driving is simple just acceleration and break with steering but don't let that fool you it can be quite difficult especially when using hand break turns and jumps.,4
Stunt Double Joe McFlash,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37493/stunt-double-joe-mcflash,"Today we're taking a look at Stunt Double Joe Mcflash! Now, I'm sure that it's the first time that a lot of you hear about this game, but I was lucky enough to try the alpha a few months ago, and I honestly couldn't wait to get my hands on the full release! So today I'm here to explain everything about the game, especially why it's so fun. So let's get this started! Stunt Double Joe Mcflash is coming out on September 2nd, 2024 in early access on the Meta store. It will be available for 15.99 Euros, and is compatible with the Meta Quest 2 and 3. The developer of the game is MoonShine Games. This is a single indie developer who made a handful of games, with Connor being his most popular one so far. I've made a review of this game in the past, so check it out if you're interested. Let's take a look at the game now. So the game is very easy to explain. You are a Stunt driver, and your job is to reach these checkpoints before the time runs out. But there's a lot of variety to it, which I'll explain later. You start the game by being in the audience of a late late show. This show is actually interviewing Joe Mcflash, who is the Stunt Double of many movies. During the interview, he basically talks about his experience in every movies that he worked on, and you're basically reliving his experience with him. Throughout the game, you'll be experiencing 5 movies, and every movie has a handful of scenes that you need to go through. The progression is great, because you're not allowed to skip any movie or scene. They unlock as you finish the next scene. You'll be going in movies such as: The Lucky Man: This is a section where you'll be driving in a very busy city with narrow streets, parking buildings, and other bigger sections. In The Country Brothers, you'll be driving through farms, dirt road, and even have a police car and chase some vigilante. This movie is definitely an homage to The Dukes of Hazzard. In Tropical Blunder, you drive through tropical forests with some ancient buildings, but as you progress through this one, you end up in a volcanic section where you have to escape. Arctic Blast is pretty self explanatory. You drive in the snow, icy areas and storms where the visibility is reduced, but you have these red smoke signals to help you out. And then the last movie is This is the End. Which is most likely a tribute to Mad Max where you drive in deserted plains in a buggy while your obstacles are usually scrap cars and damaged buildings. What's cool is that each time that you finish a movie. You are then transported to a theater to see a trailer of the movie you've worked on. Kind of a rewarding little scene. In case you don't know how to get out of the theater, like I did, you just need to click the little poster on the upper right side. So the variety is not just the environment. Your main goal is to reach the checkpoints in a certain amount of time. You'll often get slow motion scenes when you jump, and put you on the camera that's filming that scene. It's pretty satisfying as it happens, and it never really feels old, some camera angles can be pretty epic. You also get different types of objectives which keeps it fresh. Some of the scene is a car chase, there's one scene where you're literally dodging icicles popping out of nowhere. And there's even a scene where you're kind of in a traffic jam, and have to make sure that you don't hit any cars. There's tons of other little things like this, which doesn't make it boring. I also love how the game becomes more and more challenging as you go. The first movie can be a little bit of a cake walk, but I'd say that the challenge starts ramping up starting the middle of the 3rd movie. Now I must admit that I'm not the best at car driving in video games, so it might be easier for others, depending on your skills. But I personally failed a lot of times, and it took me about 4 hours to finish the game. It never felt frustrating though, except for one part that I'll talk about later, but when I usually failed, I knew that it was my fault and needed to do something better. The game is not just about putting the pedal to the metal at full speed. You really have to think how you drive the car. You might need to slow down to do a narrow turn, or to avoid an obstacle. There's also icy terrain that you have to be very careful with. The cars in the game are very responsive and handles very well. When you use your brakes while turning, you'll do a very nice drift. So I can see so people doing some very nice time attack if they're good at drifting. The one level that really frustrated me was the last scene of Arctic Blast. There's a section where you really don't have a lot of time to get to, and then you have to cross a super narrow bridge. But you can't take your time or else you wont have time to make it to the next check point. I'm not gonna lie, I've cursed a lot in this level and it didn't feel fun at all after being stuck on it for a long time. Although, the good news is that I've contacted the developer, and he will be adding some additional seconds to these checkpoints. So it shouldn't be too bad on release. Speaking of which, I did have some nice conversations with the developer. He also mentioned that he's making some improvements on the game, like lighting effects for example. As soon as I finished the game, I asked him when are we getting a sequel? Haha. I'm serious, it's really fun. The reason for that is because it's so unique. I've never seen a game like that in VR, and different ideas like this is what I'm looking for. The dev also mentioned that more movies will come in the future for this game. So keep a lookout. So, you know, the game is not perfect. It's only made by one developer after all. So I do have to mention a few nitpicks that some people may not like, and here they are. A lot of AI stuff was used. Like the movie posters, the voice acting and the music. I'm personally ok with this due to the budget that the dev has to deal with. There's also a weird thing where your hands seems to decalibrate from the wheel sometimes. So I just have to ungrab and grab the wheel again to recalibrate. There's some voice acting at the start of the scene, but sometimes it gets cut off and the game starts before he's done. There are some frustrating jumps sometimes that really don't feel fair and inconsistent. The game doesn't let you restart the scene. You have to wait for the checkpoint to time out before you can. These are the biggest things that I've noticed, but there's also other little things. I'm happy to say thought that I have not encountered any breaking bugs in my playthrough. The core of the game was pretty smooth. Alright guys as you might've noticed, I really enjoyed my time with this one, of course it lacks the quality of a bigger budget title, but it's very fun, unique, with a lot of variety. If what you see today seems like a fun time, I don't think that you'll be disappointed.",5
MxFly,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36939/mxfly,"For a demo, pretty cool. The controls are slow to react and having only one plane working with 3 in view in the options tab is a bit disappointing. Hoping they add helicopters. All in all fun to play for about 10 min. at its current development stage. But tons of potential for future updates. Looking forward to seeing what they do with it.",4

Mini Market Simulator VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36900/mini-market-simulator-vr,really easy game to learn to play. i have to play sitting down or i get a bit of motion sickness. lots of fun though.,5
DIG VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37173/dig-vr,"I'm really enjoying this game! If you're a fan of games like House Flipper, Car Mechanic Simulator, or Thief Simulator, you'll definitely enjoy it. The cozy atmosphere, crazy scenarios, and fun mini games like bowling with a digger are a lot of fun. You get lots of customization options and of course upgrading your digger is the greatest of rewards. I'm impressed by how authentic the game mechanics feel - I've never driven a digger in real life, but after playing this, I feel like I could give it a shot! The scenarios are hilarious, and I've had a blast playing this game. It's definitely a great find!",5
DIG VR,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37173/dig-vr,Dig VR is a great way to show off what it is like to be the guys and gals who work construction in a daily life. This game is very much a simulator that allows you to take the controls of a Digger in a variety of forms. There are several control schemes here that are adjustable for comfort but the full blow experience lets you get hands on with each and every level in the cabin. I was super impressed with how well it ran and how it truly shows you what its like to drive these things. It really puts in perspective what it takes when your house is getting built or any other major projects in the real world. If your into simulator games this plays very much like Lawn Mower simulator just with a Digger.,5

Hello Cruel World,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37170/hello-cruel-world,"This game puts you in the shoes of an urban explorer youtuber which feels really cool. You even have a chat that you can look at of your viewers that is randomly generated which adds to the suspense and laughter. This game is an extreme puzzler that really makes you use all your sense to solve multiple varieties of puzzles. I really like the story behind it all which I really dont want to spoil, but makes you want to keep exploring to find out what happens next. I think this is a great use of gameplay, along side a spooky story.",4
Hello Cruel World,https://sidequestvr.com/app/37170/hello-cruel-world,Total gutes Spiel . Allerdings kein Horror sondern ein RätzelSpiel. Wenn man es länger spielt kommt man auf alles drauf.. Hier mein Test,4
Wizard's Legacy,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36855/wizards-legacy,"if you enjoy games where you can cast spells then this is one to check out. Its in early access so i did find a few bugs and the AI isnt very clever so you have to run around while casting in the air which doesnt work all the time. Each shape or movement of your hands casts a different spell depending on what you select before the battle (ice, fire etc) then you can create a shape build up the power and attack with the spell. I did find that sometimes the shapes didnt work or as you were running alot they never hit correctly. sometimes i would just rather have a sword then cast spells all the time. Graphics were ok and some looked like i saw them in other game so not original. Im not really into roguelike games as i did get bored easily but i can see if you do like those games then you should check it out as it has potential.",3
Wizard's Legacy,https://sidequestvr.com/app/36855/wizards-legacy,"If you are into spellcasting and procedurally generated dungeons this one is for you. This game is in early access and does still need some polishing done to it, but has some great potential. The graphics are pretty decent but where this game really shines is its use of magic. The game makes you feel like you are truly a wizard that is casting. Although I must say it does need some improvement to it as when you are running or moving the points of contact for where the hand gesture read is a bit lacking and difficult to hit. The AI are kind of dumb as they really just run at you constantly which forces you to run and cast. There are several vendors while you are going deeper into the dungeons that will aid you along your way, with a final boss at the end of each dungeon. I do like the game but it defiantly needs a bit of polish for it to run and feel correct.",4
